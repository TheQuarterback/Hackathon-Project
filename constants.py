# Trois is a modified version of the world-renowned game, Uno, that is jointly
# developed by Anthony Lua and Wui Herng Moo Yong as part of a Hackathon
# project. Trois is a one-player game against three desicion-making bots, and
# the goal of Trois is to get rid of all your cards before the time limit or
# to have the least number fo cards by the time limit. Instructions on how to
# play Trois will be on the READ.ME.md file. We hope that you will enjoy
# playing Trois! Thank you!
